## <h1>Week 1 - Horiseon Website Refactoring</h1>

<p>This project required us to refactor the existing code for the Horiseon website homepage. the goal here was to make the code more accessible, comprehensible, efficient and practical. Also these changes should make this page more accessable for search engines. </p>

## User Story

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
